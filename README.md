# AI-Driven Passive Business Growth Engine

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Driven Passive Business Growth Engine** is a multi-model artificial intelligence system designed to automatically identify local businesses with low digital presence, evaluate their growth potential, and offer digital transformation services in a mostly passive and scalable manner.

This project focuses on **AI orchestration**, **business intelligence**, and **automation**, rather than traditional website or marketing services.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many local businesses suffer from:
- No or poor-quality websites
- No online ordering or inventory systems
- Weak customer engagement and feedback handling
- Limited visibility despite customer demand
- Lack of technical knowledge to adopt digital tools

These businesses lose customers daily but are unaware of the exact problems or solutions.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The system automatically:
1. Identifies businesses using online data
2. Evaluates their digital maturity and growth opportunity
3. Extracts customer pain points from reviews
4. Generates instant demo solutions
5. Passively communicates value
6. Monetizes services using subscription and commission models

All operations are coordinated by a **central AI Orchestrator model**.
